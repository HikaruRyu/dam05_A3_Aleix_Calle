## Introduction
In this project, we are working on two features for our octopus-themed application: octopus-hat and octopus-sailor.

## Features
### octopus-hat (Done by Your Colleague)
- Added a hat feature to the octopus.
- Added an image to the octopus.

### octopus-sailor (Your Task)
- Added the following changes to `index.html`:
  - Added a list item with the text "Is wearing a sailor hat."
  - Added a list item with the text "Is wearing scuba diving googles."
  - After the list, added an `<img>` element with the specified attributes.

## Development Workflow
1. Fork or clone the project.
2. Create a feature branch for octopus-sailor.
3. Develop your feature locally.
4. Merge your colleague's branch (octopus-hat) into the main branch.
5. Merge your feature branch (octopus-sailor) into the main branch.

## Submission
- If you initially forked the project, provide a link to your GitHub repository.
- If you didn't fork the project, submit a zip file.
- Advanced: Create a new GitHub repo, push your changes, and ensure the entire git history is included.

## Reflection
Reflect on why forking the project was chosen for this exercise. Consider whether owning a fork instead of contributing to a shared server with colleagues is a common practice in real-world scenarios.
